# Unskippable Notifications and Approvals

![Badge: Tested with Wordpress 6.5.3](https://img.shields.io/badge/tested_with_WordPress-6.5.3-blue?logo=wordpress)


> [!CAUTION]  
> This plugin isn't functional yet. Only run this in a development environment.

With this WordPress plugin, administrators can show **messages in the frontend**, which **users are forced to confirm** or react to. The user has to interact with all requests assigned to them, otherwise they are blocked from using the frontend.

The goal is to **gather and log confirmation from all or selected employees**, as well as approvals from higher ups. Consequently, this plugin is designed for internal company knowledge bases and not public websites. 

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The notifications are purposfully interrupting in nature and block a user temporarily from using the rest of the site. For more gentle announcements and a less aggressive, fully-featured document approval system, you might want to consider looking for another plugin. This is also not a messaging system.

> [!WARNING]  
> If you are less tech-savy, misconfiguration might lock yourself out of your own frontend. However, tech-savy people will have no problem to circumvent the block. This is intentionally not a bullet-proof system.
